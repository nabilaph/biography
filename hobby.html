            Speaking of hobbies, I have tried many things and consider them as hobbies. 
            Not all last long, because I get bored easily. For now, my hobby is to look for 
            new insights, whatever the field is. Lately, I like to read writings and watch videos 
            about humanity. I like it when I see different people's views. It makes me realize that 
            every person was different and makes me able to understand the nature of many people 
            even though I didn't know them at all. There is another hobby that I'm doing too, 
            namely <span><b>Embroidery</b></span>. I was interested after seeing one of the embroidery 
            works from a model from abroad. Her embroidery is not made as usual because it looks 3 dimensional. 
            The embroidery image is also simple and minimalist. After seeing many of her works, 
            I was interested to try. After trying, the results were not bad.
